## Notes

- in loadCards the order of sorting should be configurable
- make keybinding depend on algorithm? good = space is a Anki-default and might not be general
- Think about which (mobile) browsers we want to support, need to change parcel config/browserlist to support polyfilling (async/await needs polyfills for older browsers)
- Converter does not work anymore, need to import functions and add it to the build step if necessary
