## TODO

- Think about which (mobile) browsers we want to support, need to change parcel config/browserlist to support polyfilling (async/await needs polyfills for older browsers)
- How to enable API access for dev-work but not for prod version?
- Converter does not work anymore, need to import functions and add it to the build step if necessary
